there are 3 binaries here. one supports sound, one does not, one is the origional. select the one you want to use by renaming (or making a copy and renaming) it to "bootanimation". Then find the bootanimation zip you want to use, and rename it to "bootanimation.zip". also, if you are using sound, rename the sound to "Bootsound.mp3"
